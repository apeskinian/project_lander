## A simple and elegant landing zone picker for your next Fortnite Battle Royale!

Tired of the same drop spots? Debating with your squad about where to land? Let a|lander take the pressure off.

**a|lander** is your intuitive, map-driven companion for Fortnite. Designed to answer the age-old question: “Where are we landing?” With a single tap, it randomly selects a point of interest (POI) from the current map and zooms in to highlight the spot. Whether you’re looking to shake up your routine or explore hidden corners you’ve never visited, a|lander makes every exciting.

Choose between:

-  All available POIs and named locations for full exploration.
-  Main POIs only for a more focused experience.

No more indecision. No more arguments. Just a touch of fate guiding your next landing zone.
